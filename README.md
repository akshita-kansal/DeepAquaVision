# DeepAquaVision
• This project uses the deep learning technique for generating high-quality
underwater images from low-quality underwater images.
• It implementes the GAN architecture, consisting of a generator and a
discriminator, using PyTorch. The generator model consisted of several
convolutional layers for encoding and decoding the image features.
